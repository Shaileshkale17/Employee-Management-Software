## Overview

Employee Management Software is a comprehensive solution designed to manage employees, attendance, shifts, leave requests, notifications, reports, and other core HR functionalities. The system ensures efficient management, real-time updates, and scalable architecture using modern web technologies.

## High-Level Flow of the System

### 1. User Interface (Frontend)

This is where users interact with the system.

**User Actions:**

- Logging in and authentication
- Managing employees and departments
- Tracking attendance and shift scheduling
- Requesting and reviewing reports
- Applying for and approving leaves

**Technology:** React.js (Web) / React Native (Mobile)

---

### 2. Authentication Service

Handles user authentication and role-based access control.

**Functionality:**

- Users authenticate using credentials (email/password)
- JWT-based authentication for secure session management
- Role-based access control for different user levels (Admin, Manager, Employee)

**Technology:** Node.js, JWT

---

### 3. Core Services

These are the key components responsible for business logic.

#### **Attendance Service**

- Employees can mark check-in/check-out.
- Attendance status (Present, Absent, Leave) is recorded.
- Sends notifications for missing or delayed check-ins.
- Stores data in MongoDB for reporting and analysis.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB, WebSocket

#### **Shift Management Service**

- Assigns and updates shifts for employees.
- Stores shift schedules in MongoDB.
- Sends real-time notifications for shift changes.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB, WebSocket

#### **Leave Management Service**

- Employees can apply for leave (Sick, Casual, Paid, Unpaid).
- Managers approve or reject leave requests.
- Leave status updates are stored and notified.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB

#### **Notification Service**

- Sends real-time alerts for attendance, shifts, and leave updates.
- Supports WebSocket for live notifications and scheduled email/SMS alerts.

**Technology:** Node.js, WebSockets, Twilio

#### **Report Generation Service**

- Generates reports on attendance, shift schedules, leave records, and salary details.
- Data is fetched from MongoDB and formatted for viewing or export.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB

#### **Testing Service**

- Ensures all services function correctly before deployment.
- Implements unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

**Technology:** Jest, Mocha, Chai

---

### 4. Load Balancer

Distributes requests across multiple backend instances to improve scalability and fault tolerance.

**Technology:** Nginx, Node.js Cluster module

---

### 5. Queue System (Asynchronous Processing)

Handles background tasks such as report generation and notifications asynchronously.

**Technology:** RabbitMQ, Kafka

---

### 6. Database (MongoDB)

Stores all system data efficiently for fast retrieval and scalability.

**Technology:** MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas

---

### 7. Caching (Redis)

Speeds up frequently accessed data and session management.

**Technology:** Redis

---

### 8. Monitoring and Logging

Monitors system health, performance, and error tracking.

**Technology:** Prometheus, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Node.js servers can be scaled horizontally to handle more users.
- **MongoDB Scaling:** Supports sharding and replica sets for high availability.
- **Caching with Redis:** Reduces database load for frequently accessed queries.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** The queue system ensures background tasks donâ€™t slow down user interactions.

This structure provides a robust, scalable, and efficient design for the Employee Management Software.
