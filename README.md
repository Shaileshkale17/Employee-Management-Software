# Employee Management Software

## High-Level Flow of the System Diagram

### 1. User Interface (Frontend)

This is where users interact with the system.

**User Actions:** Logging in, managing employees, tracking attendance, requesting reports, assigning shifts, etc.

**Technology:** Web or mobile application (React.js/React Native).

---

### 2. Authentication Service

Responsible for verifying credentials.

**Functionality:**

- Users provide credentials (e.g., username, password).
- The Authentication Service validates credentials using JWT or Session-based Authentication.

**Technology:** Node.js (with JWT).

---

### 3. Core Services

These are the key components that handle the business logic.

#### **Attendance Service**

**Functionality:**

- Users can mark attendance (check-in/check-out).
- The system verifies if the user has already marked attendance for the day.
- Data is stored in the Attendance Collection in MongoDB.
- Tracks attendance status and sends notifications if needed.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB, WebSocket (for real-time updates).

#### **Shift Management Service**

**Functionality:**

- Managers assign, update, or view shifts for employees.
- Shift data is stored in MongoDB.
- Notification Service alerts employees of shift changes.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB, WebSocket (for real-time updates).

#### **Free Services**

**Functionality:**

- Add, update, and remove free services.
- Assign roles and permissions.
- Store service details in MongoDB.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB.

#### **Notification Service**

**Functionality:**

- Sends real-time notifications via WebSockets or scheduled emails/SMS.
- Notifications include shift changes, attendance reminders, etc.

**Technology:** Node.js, WebSockets, Email/SMS service (Twilio).

#### **Report Generation Service**

**Functionality:**

- Generates reports on attendance, shift schedules, or any custom data.
- Data is fetched from MongoDB and compiled into report formats.
- Reports can be viewed or downloaded by users.

**Technology:** Node.js, MongoDB.

#### **Testing Service**

**Functionality:**

- Ensures all services are properly tested before deployment.
- Implements unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Stores test logs and reports.

**Technology:** Jest, Mocha, Chai.

---

### 4. Load Balancer

Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend instances to prevent bottlenecks.

**Functionality:**

- Distributes requests from the Frontend to multiple backend services (Node.js servers).

**Technology:** Load balancing (Nginx).

---

### 5. Queue System (Asynchronous Processing)

Manages background tasks like notifications and report generation.

**Functionality:**

- Ensures that background tasks are queued and processed asynchronously without blocking user interactions.

**Technology:** RabbitMQ, Kafka, or similar.

---

### 6. Database (MongoDB)

Stores all system data.

**Functionality:**

- Employee data, attendance records, shift schedules, and reports are stored in collections.
- MongoDB supports horizontal scaling and can handle large data volumes.

**Technology:** MongoDB (Primary Database), MongoDB Atlas (for scaling and fault tolerance).

---

### 7. Caching (Redis)

Speeds up responses for frequently accessed data.

**Functionality:**

- Stores session data, frequently accessed queries (e.g., employee details), to reduce database load and improve response times.

**Technology:** Redis.

---

### 8. Monitoring and Logging

Keeps track of system health, performance, and error logs.

**Functionality:**

- Prometheus or similar tools monitor system metrics like request count, response time, error rates.
- ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) tracks logs and errors.
- Alerts notify admins in case of system failures or unusual activity.

**Technology:** Prometheus, ELK Stack.

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling:** Node.js servers can be scaled horizontally to handle more users.
- **MongoDB:** Supports horizontal scaling with sharding and replica sets for high availability.
- **Caching with Redis:** Helps in reducing database load by caching commonly queried data.
- **Asynchronous Processing:** The queue system ensures that long-running tasks (like generating reports) don’t block the main application flow.

This structure provides a robust, scalable, and efficient design for the Employee Management Software.
